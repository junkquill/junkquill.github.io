I am from India. Before coming to UC Santa Cruz I received my M.S. in Mathematics from the [Higher School of Economics](https://math.hse.ru/en/) in Moscow, where I wrote my [master's thesis](https://www.hse.ru/en/edu/vkr/296285338) under [Vadim Vologodsky](https://www.hse.ru/en/org/persons/160474191); and my B.S. in Mathematics, with a specialization in applied algebra, from [Shiv Nadar University](https://math.snu.edu.in/) in India.

I am passionate about mathematics pedagogy, and communicating mathematics to a general audience. I am committed to promoting inclusivity, diversity and justice in the mathematics community.

I subscribe to the following [axioms by Federico Ardila](http://www.ams.org/publications/journals/notices/201610/rnoti-p1164.pdf):
* **Axiom 1**: Mathematical talent is distributed equally among different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.
* **Axiom 2**: Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.
* **Axiom 3**: Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.
* **Axiom 4**: Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.
