I am from India. Before coming to UC Santa Cruz I received my M.S. in Mathematics from the [Higher School of Economics](https://math.hse.ru/en/) in Moscow, where I wrote my [master's thesis](https://www.hse.ru/en/edu/vkr/296285338) under [Vadim Vologodsky](https://www.hse.ru/en/org/persons/160474191); and my B.S. in Mathematics, with a specialization in applied algebra, from [Shiv Nadar University](https://math.snu.edu.in/) in India.
