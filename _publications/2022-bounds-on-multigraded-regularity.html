 We explore the asymptotic behavior of the multigraded
 Castelnuovo--Mumford regularity of powers of ideals. Specifically,
 if \(I\) is an ideal in the total coordinate ring \(S\) of a smooth
 projective toric variety \(X\), we bound the region \(\text{reg}
 (I^n) \subset \text{Pic}(X)\) by proving that it contains a
 translate of the regularity of \(S\) and is contained in a translate
 of the nef cone of \(X\). Each bound translates by a fixed vector as
 n increases. Along the way we prove that the multigraded regularity
 of a finitely generated torsion-free module is contained in a
 translate of the nef cone determined by the degrees of the
 generators of M, and thus contains only finitely many minimal
 elements.
