We compute the top-weight rational cohomology of \(\mathcal{A}_g\) for \(g=5\), \(6\),
and \(7\),  and we give some vanishing results for the top-weight rational
cohomology of \(\mathcal{A}_{8}, \mathcal{A}_{9}\) and \(\mathcal{A}_{10}\). When \(g=5\) and \(g=7\), we
exhibit nonzero cohomology groups of \(\mathcal{A}_g\) in odd degree, thus
answering a question highlighted by Grushevsky. Our methods develop the
relationship between the top-weight cohomology of \(\mathcal{A}_g\) and the
homology of the link of the moduli space of principally polarized
tropical abelian varieties of rank \(g\). To compute the latter we use the
Voronoi complexes used by Elbaz-Vincent-Gangl-Soul\'e. Our computations
give natural candidates for compactly supported cohomology classes of
\(\mathcal{A}_g\) in weight $0$ that produce the stable cohomology classes of the
Satake compactification of \(\mathcal{A}_g\) in weight \(0\), under the Gysin
spectral sequence for the latter space.
