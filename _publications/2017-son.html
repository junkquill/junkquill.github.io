  We provide a closed formula for the degree of \(\text{SO}(n)\) over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. In addition, we describe symbolic and numerical techniques which can also be used to compute the degree of \(\text{SO}(n)\) for small values of \(n\). As an application of our results, we give a formula for the number of critical points of a low-rank semidefinite programming optimization problem. Finally, we provide some evidence for a conjecture regarding the real locus of \(\text{SO}(n)\).
