We study systems of parameters over finite fields from a probabilistic perspective. Our central technique is an adaptation of Poonen's closed point sieve, where we sieve over higher dimensional subvarieties, and we express the desired probabilities via a zeta function-like power series that enumerates higher dimensional varieties instead of closed points. Applications include an effective Noether normalization result over a finite field, and a new proof of a recent result of Gabber-Liu-Lorenzini and Chinburg-Moret-Bailly-Pappas-Taylor on uniform Noether normalizations for projective families over the integers.
