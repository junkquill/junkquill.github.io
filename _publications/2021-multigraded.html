 We explore the relationship between multigraded Castelnuovo--Mumford
 regularity, truncations, Betti numbers, and virtual resolutions. We
 prove that on a product of projective spaces \(X\), the multigraded
 regularity region of a module \(M\) is determined by the minimal graded
 free resolutions of the truncations \(M_{\geq\textbf{d}}\)$ for \(\textbf{d}\in\text{Pic} X\).
 Further, by relating the minimal graded free resolutions of \(M\) and
 \(M_{\geq\textbf{d}}\) we provide a new bound on multigraded regularity of \(M\)
 in terms of its Betti numbers. Using this characterization of
 regularity and this bound we also compute the multigraded
 Castelnuovo--Mumford regularity for a wide class of complete
 intersections.
