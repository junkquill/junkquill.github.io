  This paper explores the relationship between real valued monomial valuations on \(k(x,y)\), the resolution of cusp singularities, and continued fractions. It is shown that up to equivalence there is a one to one correspondence between real valued monomial valuations on \(k(x,y)\) and continued fraction expansions of real numbers between zero and one. This relationship with continued fractions is then used to provide a characterization of the valuation rings for real valued monomial valuations on \(k(x,y)\). In the case when the monomial valuation is equivalent to an integral monomial valuation, we exhibit explicit generators of the valuation rings. Finally, we demonstrate that if v is a monomial valuation such that \(\nu(x)=a\) and \(\nu(y)=b\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are relatively prime positive integers larger than one, then \(\nu\) governs a resolution of the singularities of the plane curve \(x^b=y^a\) in a way we make explicit. Further, we provide an exact bound on the number of blow ups needed to resolve singularities in terms of the continued fraction of \(a/b\).
